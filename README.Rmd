title: DFM â€“ Dmenu File Manager
output: amaryaml::github

![](preview.png)

DFM is a simple file manager that uses Dmenu.
Instead of opening a slow graphical environment, you open Dmenu and quickly choose whatever file you want to manipulate.
It supports multiple selections and wildcards.
This project has reached the point to being basically flawless, so it is unlikely that I will be updating it soon.
But please submit an issue or a pull request if you do want any changes.

# Usage

```sh
`# user` dfm --raw # Print the raw output of the selection
`# user` dfm --copy # Copy the raw output of the selection
`# user` dfm --copy-contents # Copy the contents of the selection
`# user` dfm --program # Open the appropriate program for the selection
```

The default is the `program` option.

# Dependencies

#. dmenu
#. xdg-utils
#. gtk+
#. xclip (if you want to use the *copy* or *copy contents* features.)

Most of these will probably already be installed on your system, with the exception of Dmenu.
