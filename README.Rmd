title: DFM â€“ Dmenu File Manager

![](preview.png)

DFM is a simple file manager that uses Dmenu.
Instead of opening a slow graphical environment, you open Dmenu and quickly choose whatever file you want to manipulate.
Unfortunately, it does not **yet** support multi-selection.
I am planning on implementing it soon though.

# Usage

Use the `dfm` command to select any file.
There are three options for DFM:

#. open the default program for the file (`-p`/`--program`)
#. copy the contents of the file (`-c`/`--copy-file`)
#. copy a line from the contents for the file (`-cf`/`--copy-file`)

The default is the program option.

# Dependencies

#. Dmenu
#. Xclip (if you want to use the *copy* or *copy file* features.)

# Installation

## Universal

```sh
`# user` git clone https://github.com/amarakon/dfm
`# user` cd dfm
`# root` make install
```

## Gentoo

```sh
`# root` eselect repository add amarlay git https://github.com/amarakon/amarlay
`# root` emerge --sync amarlay
`# root` emerge x11-misc/dfm
```

# Uninstallation

## Universal

```sh
`# user` cd dfm
`# root` make uninstall
```

## Gentoo

```sh
`# root` emerge -c x11-misc/dfm
# Remove my overlay (optional)
`# root` eselect-repository remove -f amarlay
`# root` emerge --sync
```
