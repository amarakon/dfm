title: DFM â€“ Dmenu File Manager

![](preview.gif)

DFM is a simple file manager that uses Dmenu.
Instead of opening a slow graphical environment, you open Dmenu and quickly choose whatever file you want to manipulate.
It supports multiple selections and wildcards.
DFM is the fastest file manager because it is only usable with the keyboard.
Please submit an issue or a pull request if you do want any changes.

# Usage

```sh
`# user` dfm --raw # Print the raw output of the selection
`# user` dfm --copy # Copy the raw output of the selection
`# user` dfm --copy-contents # Copy the contents of the selection
`# user` dfm --program # Open the appropriate program for the selection
```

The default is the `program` option.

To select one file, press the `Return` key.
To use the input instead of the selection, press `Shift+Return` (not necessary most of the time).
To select multiple files, press `Control+Return` on each selection and press `Return` when you are finished.
To select all the files, type `*`.
To go to the home directory, type `~`.
To go back a directory, type `..`.
To go to the `/` directory, type `/`.

# Dependencies

#. dmenu
#. xdg-utils
#. gtk+
#. xclip (if you want to use the *copy* or *copy contents* features.)

Most of these will probably already be installed on your system, with the exception of Dmenu.
